# ToDoVista
ToDoVista is a simple ToDo application made native for Windows Vista. It's perfect for beginner programmers to learn creating Windows Native GUI applications using C# language. It's good for those who would like to feel that nostalgic feeling making small projects in Visual C# 2008-2010 or old OSes.

## Background
So I often use ToDo applications such as Microsoft To-Do, Google Tasks, etc. I decided to install Windows Vista in a VM and use it as my daily OS for a while to remember the first time I had a laptop (Windows Vista OEM installed!). But then I realize that I need a ToDo applications to even manage my tasks in an old OS. The first time I learned code was also in a Windows Vista environtment using Visual C# 2008. And while I got nothing to do in weekend, I try to made this app.

## Technical Specification
This application was made using:
- Visual C# 2008 Express
- .NET Framework 3.x.x (I forgot, I'll revise this later)

## Installation Instructions
Because technically it isn't done yet (the complete todo is still work in progress), technically there are no releases (portable or setup-based) yet. To try to use it, simply open the project using Visual C# 2008-2010 (Or Visual Studio with .NET Framework (Native Windows) feature installed) and try to run or build it yourself.

### Changelogs
- 0.1.0 - Initial project creation
